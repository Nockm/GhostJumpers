# Ghost Jumpers
Example RetroWar minigame

Copyright 2017 Electron Studio

Originally an example of how to make a minigame that could run standalone and also
be loaded into RetroWar as a plugin.  Still useful for that purpose but it's now
being expanded a little to make a Donkey Kong clone.  May be merged into main
source at some point, and then this repo will remain as an example.

Graphics are based on Simples Pimples art set.
