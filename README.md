# Ghost Jumpers
Example RetroWar minigame

Originally an example of how to make a minigame that could run standalone and also
be loaded into RetroWar as a plugin.  Still useful for that purpose but it's now
being expanded a little to make a Donkey Kong clone.  May be merged into main
source at some point, and then this repo will remain as an example.

Once the game has started each player must hit fire on their controller or space on the keyboard to join the game.  To skip levels hit 'N'.

Graphics are based on Simples Pimples art set by [Surt](https://opengameart.org/content/simple-broad-purpose-tileset)
